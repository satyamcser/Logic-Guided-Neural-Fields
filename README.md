# Logic-Guided Neural Fields (L-GNF)

This repository contains the full implementation of **L-GNF**, our model for verifiable spatiotemporal learning under Signal Temporal Logic (STL) constraints.

All experiments, training scripts, STL loss computation, ablation studies, and visualizations from the paper are included in the notebook:

## To run:

```bash
jupyter notebook GEn_CITy.ipynb
```
